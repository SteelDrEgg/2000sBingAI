Download source code and unzip

> For those in regions where login is needed for Bing chat, checkout [profect EdgeGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT#collect-cookies) for how to get Cookie, then modify line 9 in `bingbot.py` **OR** star this project to let me know someone cares about it.

cd into directory then download dependencies

### Why I do this?

It's so cool if we have super AI in 2000s!

I'll call it the **Millenniumtechpunk**, which is the combination of Millennium Tech and Punk.
